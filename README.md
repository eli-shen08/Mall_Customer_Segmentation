# Mall_Customer_Segmentation
Created clusters with features of people related to shopping mall .
Also a cool 3D clustering cluster graph to see .
I have also created a Cluster Recommendation Engine based on the provided data .

I have used KMeans Clustering to tackle this problem where i have used the elbow method to find th optimal number of clusters .

Run the line below the markdown "3D graph showing clusters " to view this cool graph .
Below this is the cluster recommendation engine where you can put certain customer details related to shopping in the mall as well as their own features to predict which cluster they fall into.
